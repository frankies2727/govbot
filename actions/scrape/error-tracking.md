# Scrape Action — Error Tracking

Track the status of the scrape action across all 57 jurisdictions.

**Statuses:** `✅ OK` | `❌ Broken` | `⚠️ Intermittent` | `⏸️ Unknown`

Last updated: 2026-06-26

## Summary of Failures

### A — Out of Session (scraper finds no data, legislature not meeting)
These should not be hard failures. `ct`, `nm`

**Fix in progress:** Branch `fix/scrape-no-new-data` updates `action.yml` to treat a non-zero
scraper exit code as a soft failure when fallback data is available. The workflow yml files in
`ct-legislation` and `nm-legislation` repos have been temporarily pointed
to `chihacknight/govbot/actions/scrape@fix/scrape-no-new-data` for testing.

⚠️ **TODO on merge to main:** Update those 2 state repos back to `@main`:
- `govbot-openstates-scrapers/ct-legislation` — `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- `govbot-openstates-scrapers/nm-legislation` — `.github/workflows/*.yml`

### F — Active Scraper Blocking (state is deliberately preventing automated access to public data)
`tx`

Texas returns `ConnectionRefusedError [Errno 111]` — the server is actively refusing TCP
connections from GitHub Actions IP ranges before any HTTP request is even made. This is not
an out-of-session issue: the Texas legislature actively meets and produces data, but access
is being blocked. This is a transparency problem and a priority to fix.

Unlike a timeout or a site being down, connection refused is an intentional firewall-level
decision. The `fix/scrape-no-new-data` branch will prevent daily hard failures for TX by
falling back to prior data, but that is a stopgap — TX data will go stale without a real fix.

**Options to investigate:**
- Route TX scrapes through a non-GitHub-Actions IP (self-hosted runner, proxy, or VPS)
- Check if OpenStates has an alternative data source for TX that doesn't hit capitol.texas.gov directly
- Monitor whether other civic tech orgs (e.g., Plural Policy, LegiScan) have TX data available

⚠️ **TODO on merge to main:** Update tx-legislation back to `@main`:
- `govbot-openstates-scrapers/tx-legislation` — `.github/workflows/*.yml`

### B — Government Site Structure Changed (need OpenStates scraper fixes)
The source website changed its HTML/API; the OpenStates scraper is broken until updated upstream.
`az`, `hi`, `la`, `nj`, `tn`

### C — OCD Validation Failures (data fails Open Civic Data schema validation)
Scraper runs and fetches data, but bill records fail internal validation.
`dc`, `mp`

### D — Connectivity Issues (network timeouts / connection refused)
`nh` (timeout), `wi` (intermittent timeout)

### E — Workflows Disabled / No Recent Runs
`va`, `vi` — last run 2026-04-01; workflows appear disabled
