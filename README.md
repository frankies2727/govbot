# 🏛️ govbot

`govbot` enables distributed data anaylsis of government updates via a friendly terminal interface. Git repos function as datasets, including the legislation of all 47 states/jurisdictions.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chihacknight/govbot/main/actions/govbot/scripts/install-nightly.sh)"
```

### 2. Set up your project

```bash
govbot
```

Running `govbot` with no config file launches an interactive setup wizard that:
1. Asks what data sources you want (all 47 states or specific ones)
2. Guides you through creating tags for topics you care about
3. Creates `govbot.yml`, `.gitignore`, and a GitHub Actions workflow

### 3. Run the pipeline

```bash
govbot
```

With a `govbot.yml` in your directory, running `govbot` executes the full pipeline:
1. Clones/updates legislation repositories
2. Tags bills based on your tag definitions
3. Generates RSS feeds in the `docs/` directory

### Other Commands

```bash
govbot clone all           # download all state legislation datasets
govbot clone il ca ny      # download specific states
govbot logs                # stream legislative activity as JSON Lines
govbot logs | govbot tag   # process and tag data
govbot build               # generate RSS feeds
govbot load                # load bill metadata into DuckDB
govbot delete all          # remove all downloaded data
govbot update              # update govbot to latest version
govbot --help              # see all commands and options
```

# 🏛️ Govbot Legislation Effort

- Nearly all state governments
- Federal

WIP: Ideally, these scripts should be accessible via the following ways.

- CLI / Unix pipe friendliness where possible. CLI is the most portable of solutions.
- GitHub Actionable if possible

## Contribute

### Folder Structure

This repo is a monorepo, with `actions` being self contained. `actions` as a name is because it's what Github expects.

### Requirements For Each Action

- Be a runnable as basic scripts in python, bash, rust, or typescript which can run as shell scripts with args.
- Have an `action.yml` file to run as a runner, most likely in GitHub Actions.
- Have a `schemas` folder that uses JSON schema to define types.
  - This allow other actions to import your schema for validation.
- Have `__snapshots__` that contain real file/folder outputs. This serves two purposes: (1) they show expected results and (2) they can be directly used as inputs for downstream snapshot tests.
  - Each action manages its own snapshot rendering through a render_snapshots.sh script.
  - Validation occurs via .github/validate-snapshots.yml for each specific module.
