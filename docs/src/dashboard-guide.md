# Legislation Dashboard

**[Open the dashboard →](./dashboard/index.html)**

A static, client-side dashboard over bill data from every tracked jurisdiction,
filterable by state/territory, session, chamber, topic tag, and free-text search.
It is plain HTML/JS with no external dependencies, deployed as part of this docs
site by the existing GitHub Pages workflow.

## What it shows

- **Stat tiles** — bill count, jurisdictions, sessions, and share of bills with topic tags
- **Bills by jurisdiction** and **bills by topic** bar charts (click a bar to filter)
- **Activity by month** — bills by the month of their most recent recorded action
- **Bills table** — sortable, with topic chips and links to each bill's official source

All charts, tiles, and the table re-render against the same filtered slice, so the
numbers always agree.

## Where the data comes from

The page reads a single `data.json` produced by
[`scripts/build_dashboard_data.py`](https://github.com/chihacknight/govbot/blob/main/scripts/build_dashboard_data.py),
which scans cloned govbot dataset repos for bills in either format — govbot's
OCD-files layout (`**/bills/<ID>/metadata.json`) or raw OpenStates scraper
output (`_data/<locale>/bill_<uuid>.json`) — and joins topic tags from
`govbot tag` output (`tags/*.tag.json`).

On every Pages deploy (and on a daily 8am UTC schedule), the workflow shallow-clones
every `*-legislation` repo from the
[govbot-openstates-scrapers](https://github.com/govbot-openstates-scrapers)
organization and rebuilds `data.json` from all of them, so the published dashboard
covers every tracked jurisdiction. If that step fails, the deploy falls back to the
committed sample data rather than breaking the docs site.

The committed sample data is built from the offline mocks
(`actions/govbot/mocks/.govbot` — Wyoming and Guam), with demo topics derived from
the keyword definitions in `scripts/dashboard_tags.json` (the same shape as the
`tags:` section of `govbot.yml`, keyword-only mode):

```bash
python3 scripts/build_dashboard_data.py \
  --govbot-dir actions/govbot/mocks/.govbot \
  --tags-config scripts/dashboard_tags.json \
  --output docs/src/dashboard/data.json
```

## Regenerating locally with real data

```bash
govbot clone all        # clone the dataset repos (~/.govbot/repos)
govbot tag              # optional: score bills against your govbot.yml tags
python3 scripts/build_dashboard_data.py --output docs/src/dashboard/data.json
```

When real `tags/*.tag.json` files exist for a session, they take precedence over
the keyword fallback; a bill gets a tag when its `final_score` meets the tag's
configured threshold. Commit the regenerated `data.json` and the Pages workflow
publishes it with the rest of the docs.
